# Week5-DaySchedular

A basic browswer application that allows a user to save tasks hourly as a form of reminder. The app is set to go grey when a hour has passed, red when the hour is current and green the hour is upcoming. All data will be saved into the users local storage. A clear button is also present to allow the user to clear the schedule.

Overall Thoughts:
This activity was quite interesting to make,  would like to have the timer be live instead of the time being static each time the page is refreashed. I do intend to apply this to my workplace however make it accessible via SQL where the user can access their tasks based on their log in details when logging into our management system online.

Currently i am still unable to link my images so that it is viewable on the readme file when uploading to github
